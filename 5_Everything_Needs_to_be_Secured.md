## 5.1.1 Types of Data

- Has data really changed? Well technically no, data generated by computers and digital devices is still groups of 1s and 0s. That has not changed. What has changed is the quantity, volume, variety, and immediacy of the generated data
- Historically companies would have access to our information gathered from forms, spreadsheets, applications, credit card purchases and other types of files. Much of the information was stored and analyzed at a later date. Sensitive data was still collected, stored and analyzed but, historically, hackers were more interested in hacking into systems to obtain corporate or government secrets
- Today, gathered data is taking on new characteristics. The digitized world has opened the floodgates for data gathering. IoT sensor-enabled devices are collecting more and more data of a personal nature. Wearable fitness trackers, home monitoring systems, security cameras, and debit card transactions are all collecting personal data as well as business and environmental data. Data is often combined from different sources and users may be unaware of this. Combining fitness monitoring data with house monitoring data could produce data points to help map the movements or location of a homeowner. This changing type of data collection and aggregation can be used for good purposes to help the environment. It also increases the possibility of invasion of our privacy, identity theft, and corporate espionage
- Personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal information (SPI) is any data relating to a living individual that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual. The data gathered by companies and government institutions can also contain sensitive information concerning corporate secrets, new product patents, or national security
- Because we are gathering and storing exponential quantities of both sensitive and informational data, it has increased the need for extra security to protect this information from natural disasters, hackers, and misuse

- PII
    - Social security number
    - Email address
    - Bank account numbers
    - Student tuition bill
    - Credit rating
    - Debit card number
    - Fingerprints
    - Birth date
    - Username/password
    - Vehicle identification number (VIN)
    - Mortgage information
    - Home address
    - Facebook photographs
- Informational
    - Rain gauge value
    - Number of cars through an intersection
    - Hospital emergency use per state
    - Average plane capacity
    - House thermometer reading
    - Census data
    - Immigration values
    - Average potato crops per province
    - Next train time per station
    - Average gas consumption per flight

## 5.1.2 Lab – Types of Data
- In this lab, we will review different types of collected data and determine if it is sensitive in nature and who might benefit from stealing it

## 5.1.3 Who Wants our Data?

- Good Actors
    - Legitimate companies have an agreement in place that gives them permission to use the collected data about you for purposes of improving their business. Remember those “Terms and Conditions” or “Terms of Service and Agreements” documents that we say yes to but do not usually read? The next time that you are presented with one, take the time to read through it. The contents might surprise you
    - Other legitimate users of our data would be companies that use sensors on their own devices or vehicles. Governments that have environmental sensors, and cities who have installed sensors on trains, busses or traffic lights also have a right to the data they generate
    - Some hackers, called white hat hackers, are paid by legitimate companies and governments to test the security of a device or system. Their goal is not to steal or modify data but to help to protect it. Benevolent hacking competitions, such as Pwn2Own, encourage hackers to find vulnerabilities and launch exploits against commonly used software and systems. Hackers who successfully find and properly divulge their findings receive cash prices that can amount to a million or more dollars 
    - Many people blindly accept user agreements. Mobile users install apps and freely grant privileged access to their data without giving it a second thought. However, corporations and others can abuse individual privacy rights and use customer data for potentially unethical purposes. For this reason, the European Union created the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to force corporations and other entities to respect the individual’s right to data privacy
- Bad Actors
    - Other hackers, called black hat hackers, want access to collected data for many nefarious reasons:
        - To sell the information to a third party
        - To modify the data or disable functionality on a device
        - To disrupt or to damage the image of a legitimate company
        - To access devices, web pages, and data to create political unrest or to make a political statement
        - To access user IDs and passwords to steal identities
        - To access data to commit a crime
        - To hack into systems to prove that they can do it

## 5.1.4 Data in the Wrong Hands

- Hackers have accessed the data of many companies over the years. The impact is significant and has resulted in the data of millions of users being released on the web
- According to recent news, login credentials and other personal data linked to more than one million Yahoo and Gmail accounts are reportedly being offered for sale on the dark web marketplace
- The online accounts listed for sale on the Dark Web allegedly contain usernames, emails, and plaintext passwords. The accounts are not from a single data breach; instead, several major cyber-attacks are believed to have been behind it
- Cybercriminals penetrated Equifax (EFX), one of the largest credit bureaus, in July 2017 and stole the personal data of 145 million people. It was considered among the worst breaches of all time because of the amount of sensitive information exposed, including Social Security numbers
- The company only revealed the hack two months later. It could have an impact for years because the stolen data could be used for identity theft
- The breach in 2018 affected an estimated 150 million users of its food and nutrition application, MyFitnessPal
- The investigation indicates that affected information may include usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords
- Uber, a ride share company based in San Francisco, CA, disclosed late in 2016 that hackers had stolen 57 million driver and rider accounts and that the company had kept the data breach secret for more than a year after paying a $100,000 ransom. The breach cost Uber in both reputation and money

## 5.1.6 Lab - Internet Fingerprint

- The purpose of this lab is to introduce the aspect of “fingerprinting” an individual using the worldwide web. The objective is to introduce various methods to extract as much information as possible using only the internet browser and various sites effectively

## 5.2.1 Security Best Practices

- Security policies, procedures, and standards must be followed in the design of all aspects of the entire network. This should include the cables, data in transit, stored data, networking devices, and end devices

- Some security best practices are listed in the table

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29455975/186655104-be6f8fe7-5196-4ea5-b769-e0e3fc1accfa.png)

## 5.2.2 Physical Security

- Today’s data centers store vast quantities of sensitive, business-critical information; therefore, physical security is an operational priority. Physical security not only protects access to the premises, but also protects people and equipment. For example, fire alarms, sprinklers, seismically-braced server racks, and redundant heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and UPS systems are in place to protect people and equipment
- Physical security within the data center can be divided into two areas, outside and inside
- Outside perimeter security- This can include on-premise security officers, fences, gates, continuous video surveillance, and security breach alarms
- Inside perimeter security - This can include continuous video surveillance, electronic motion detectors, security traps, and biometric access and exit sensors
- Security traps provide access to the data halls where data center data is stored. A security trap is similar to an air lock. A person must first enter the security trap using their badge ID proximity card. After the person is inside the security trap, facial recognition, fingerprints, or other biometric verifications are used to open the second door. The user must repeat the process to exit the facility

## 5.2.3 Challenges of Securing IoT devices5.2.3 Challenges of Securing IoT devices

- IoT devices are developed with the necessary network connectivity capabilities but often do not implement strong network security. Network security is a critical factor when deploying IoT devices. Methods must be taken to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and security of the data, the path from the sensor to the collector, and the connectivity to the device
- Increasing Number of Devices
    - The number of interconnected sensors and smart devices is growing exponentially, increasing the opportunity for attacks. Sensors and smart devices tend to be small devices, with varying operating systems, CPU types, and memory. Many of these objects will be inexpensive, single-function devices with rudimentary network connectivity
- Non-Traditional Location of Devices
    - Some connected IoT devices are able to interact with the physical world. They are now located in appliances, in automobiles, on or in our bodies, and in our homes. Sensors may gather data from the refrigerator or the heating system. They could also be located in city lampposts or attached to tree trunks. These non-traditional locations make physical security difficult or impossible to achieve. The devices should be manufactured to be resistant to tampering, and they should be placed so that they are not obvious and are very difficult to access
- Lack of Upgradeability
    - IoT sensor-enabled devices may be located in remote and/or inaccessible locations where human intervention or configuration is almost impossible. The devices are often designed to be in service many years longer than is typical for conventional high-tech equipment. Some IoT devices are intentionally designed without the ability to be upgraded, or they might be deployed in situations that make it difficult or impossible to reconfigure or upgrade. New vulnerabilities are uncovered all of the time. If a device is non-upgradeable, then the vulnerability will exist for the rest of its lifetime. If a device is upgradeable, the typical consumer may not have a technology background, therefore, the upgrade process should perform automatically or be easy enough to be performed by a layperson

## 5.2.4 Safe Wi-Fi Usage5.2.4 Safe Wi-Fi Usage

- Wireless networks are popular in all types and sizes of businesses because they are easy to set up and convenient to use. For employees and guests, the company needs to deliver a wireless experience that enables mobility and security. If a wireless network is not properly secured, hackers within range can access it and infiltrate the network

- The table outlines the steps to take to help to protect a wireless network

## 5.3.3 Smart Homes

- Smart home technology has become very popular and its popularity is increasing every year as the technology evolves. Who doesn’t find it appealing to turn your home thermostat up or down while you are at work, or to have your refrigerator order groceries to be delivered when you get home? How cool is it to check on the dog or to verify that your teenagers are doing their homework after school by activating your home security cameras?
- As we install more and more smart sensors into our homes, we increase the potential for security issues. Often the sensors are connected to the same network as our home or small business devices so that a breach of one device can radiate outwards to affect all connected devices. The sensors could also provide a way for hackers to get into our home network and gain access to any PCs and data that are connected to it
- Even virtual assistants such as Apple SIRI, Amazon Echo, or Google Home can be security risks. People use these devices to turn on music, adjust room temperatures, order products on-line, and get directions for where they are going. Can this cause any harm? It is possible that personal information such as passwords or credit card information could be leaked
- Fortunately many of the security flaws of the early smart technology sensors have already been discovered. Developers are working to correct the flaws and improve security measures to protect their systems from attack. Before purchasing home security systems, it is very important to research the developer and the security and encryption protocols that are in place for its products

## 5.3.4 Public Hotspots5.3.4 Public Hotspots

- When you are away from home, a public Wi-Fi hotspot allows you to access your online information and surf the internet. Common activities on public Wi-Fi include logging into a personal email account, entering personally identifiable information, logging into social media, and accessing bank or financial information. All of this information could be stolen if the Wi-Fi connection is unsecure
- Safety rules to follow if you are using a public or unsecure Wi-Fi hotspot:
    - Do not access or send any sensitive personal information over a public wireless network
    -Verify whether your computer is configured with file and media sharing, and that it requires user authentication with encryption
    - Use encrypted virtual private network (VPN) tunnels and services. The VPN service provides you secure access to the internet, with an encrypted connection between your computer and the VPN service provider’s VPN server. With an encrypted VPN tunnel, even if a data transmission is intercepted, it is not decipherable
    - Many mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, come with the Bluetooth wireless protocol. This capability allows Bluetooth-enabled devices to connect to each other and share information. Unfortunately, Bluetooth can be exploited by hackers to eavesdrop on some devices, establish remote access controls, distribute malware, and drain batteries. To avoid these issues, keep Bluetooth turned off when you are not using it

## 5.3.5 Lab - Discover Your Own Risky Online Behavior

- In this lab, you will explore actions performed online that may compromise your safety or privacy

## 5.3.6 Iota - Reflection

- At first it might seem disappointing that the IoT needs to be secured. But think of it this way – there will always be jobs available for people who work in cybersecurity, and the IoT will need as much, if not more cybersecurity than most networks. And who knows? Maybe YOU will be the person who figures out a better way to secure the IoT for everyone

## 5.4.1 Everything Needs to be Secured Summary

- Why is Security so Important?
- This module began by discussing the types of data. Personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal information (SPI) is any data relating to a living individual that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual. Legitimate companies have an agreements (Terms and Conditions, or Terms of Service) that gives them permission to use the collected data about you for purposes of improving their business.

Governments that have environmental sensors, and cities that have installed sensors on trains, busses or traffic lights also have a right to the data they generate
- Some hackers, called white hat hackers, are paid by legitimate companies and governments to test the security of a device or system. Their goal is not to steal or modify data but to help to protect it. Black hat hackers want access to collected data for many reasons, including selling it, damaging the reputation of a person or company, and causing political unrest
- Protecting the Corporate World
    - Next, the module detailed security best practices. Security includes physically securing the outside and inside perimeters of places, such as data centers, where data is stored. Securing IoT devices is challenging due to the sheer number of them, the fact that they are found in non-traditional locations, and that many of them cannot be upgraded. Black hat hackers frequently access available Wi-Fi. There are many steps you can take to protect your company’s wireless network. To protect devices, keep the firewall turned on, manage your operating system and browser, and use antivirus and antispyware
- Safety rules to follow if you are using a public or unsecure Wi-Fi hotspot:
    - Do not access or send any sensitive personal information over a public wireless network 
    - Verify whether your computer is configured with file and media sharing, and that it requires user authentication with encryption
    - Use encrypted virtual private network (VPN) tunnels and services. The VPN service provides you secure access to the internet, with an encrypted connection between your computer and the VPN service provider’s VPN server. With an encrypted VPN tunnel, even if a data transmission is intercepted, it is not decipherable
- Securing Personal Data and Devices
    - As we install more and more smart sensors into our homes, we do increase the potential for security issues. Often the sensors are connected to the same network as our home or small business devices so that a breach of one device can radiate outwards to affect all connected devices
