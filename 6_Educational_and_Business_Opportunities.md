## 6.1.1 Become an Informed Consumer

- The last few years have given us improvements in the speed and availability of internet services, as well as advances in cloud computing and sensor technology. These technical gains, together with recent developments in automation and artificial intelligence, have created a highly digitized world. Digitization currently impacts every aspect of our daily lives. Digitization continues to provide new opportunities for professionals who are trained to develop and support the technology that is used to deliver the IoT
- The IoT provides an immeasurable amount of information that is readily available for consumption. This information can be quickly analyzed and used to automate many processes that were previously considered impossible to turn over to machines. For example, just a few years ago self-driving cars existed only in our imaginations and now they are a reality. Think about what else has changed in your life because of the IoT
- The IoT is also freeing humans from the drudgery of routine and repetitive tasks such as restocking shelves and order fulfillment. We may now have more time for higher intellectual pursuits and the chance to explore all the IoT has to offer
- We are at a point in time in which opportunities are limited only by our imagination. We now have the ability to embrace all of the benefits that the IoT has to offer and to help shape the future. How will you use the IoT to help improve the future?

## 6.1.2 Challenges in the Digitized World

- The IoT provides many benefits but at the same time it presents many challenges. Because the IoT is a transformational technology, we are now faced with an ever expanding collection of new technology that we must master. The IoT is changing every aspect of our lives
- This is not the first time we have experienced a technological development that has such an impact. Mechanization on the farm allowed increased productivity of available farmland and started the migration of the population from rural to urban areas. The development of the automobile allowed for greater mobility of the workforce and increased recreational activities. The personal computer allowed the automation of many routine tasks with improved accuracy and efficiency. The internet started to break down geographic barriers and improve equality between people on a global scale. These are only a few of the transformational technologies that we have experienced in recent history
- Every one of these technologies presented major changes to an established society and was met with initial fear and apprehension. After the initial fear of the unknown was overcome and the technology was embraced, the inherent benefits became obvious. Each perceived challenge opens up many new opportunities
- Can you imagine how your life would be without a car, personal computer, or access to the internet?

## 6.1.3 The Evolving Job Market

- The IoT is changing the job market. Traditional jobs are being replaced with jobs that are designed to embrace this new world and all it offers
- In IT, opportunities may be specific to edge computing, developing new processes, or a specialization in a discipline that has not yet been realized. These jobs reflect skills spanning multiple disciplines that include computer science, computer engineering (a blend of computer science and electrical engineering), and software engineering in the following areas:
    - Artificial Intelligence
    - Application Development
    - IoT Program Developer
    - IoT Security Specialist 
    - Collaboration
    - Enterprise Networks
    - Data Center and Virtualization

- Not all jobs created by the IoT are IT-related. The IoT should be considered an enabling technology which has applications across all industries and aspects of our daily lives. For example, a city planner uses the data collected by IoT-enabled devices to plan out new city services. Sales people use IoT technology to enhance the sales experience with the customer, and stores use IoT technology to maintain proper inventory levels to match customer demand
- The IoT has created an abundance of jobs within its sphere. These jobs exist across various spectrums of the design, development and enabling of the IoT. There are broad categories that summarize the job opportunities that exist in the evolving digitized world:
    - Enablers – These jobs develop and implement the underlying technology.
    - Engagers –These jobs design, create, integrate, and deliver IoT services to customers.
    - Enhancers – These jobs devise their own value-added services, on top of the services provided by Engagers, which are unique to the Internet of Things

## 6.1.4 Entrepreneurs Needed!

- The IoT is also creating a demand for a new kind of IT specialist. These are individuals with the knowledge and skillsets to develop new IoT-enabled products and process the data they collect
- An entrepreneurial workforce is needed that specializes in both information science and software or computer engineering
- Additionally, operational technologies and information technologies are converging in the IoT. With this convergence, people must collaborate and learn from each other to understand the things, the networks, and methodologies that harness the limitless potential of the IoT

## 6.1.5 Lifelong Learning

- With the ever-changing landscape of the digitized world, we must stay current in order to realize the full potential of what the IoT has to offer

- The job market will continue to offer more opportunities as new technologies evolve. The skill sets required for these jobs will evolve at the same time, thus creating the need for lifelong learning

## 6.2.1 Communities of Interest
- A community of interest is a group of people who share a common interest or passion about a specific topic. These people get together to share information and ideas about this topic
- This shared interest allows the group to develop into a true community. Members of these communities are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the topic being discussed and are willing to share their knowledge with other community members. This makes the community an excellent resource for the development of the area of interest
- The internet allows these communities to exist virtually and span several geographic areas and time zones. Members can share files and technology in real time
- Several IoT communities exist. The IEEE runs an IoT community, as does LinkedIn. Many other technology-related organizations have IoT interest groups. The IoT World Today site and email list is an outlet for IoT related news and developments. To better understand the ever-developing world of IoT technologies, subscribe to an IoT news resource to view daily developments
- Some communities are supported by industry and provide a place to help development of their products and technology, as well as those of their business partners. Two such communities provided by Cisco are the Cisco Learning Network and Cisco DevNet
- The Cisco Learning Network is a collection of resources, information, and discussion forums. It is designed for people who wish to develop their skills in various Cisco technologies and pursue Cisco certification. To see what the Cisco Learning Network has to offer and to become a member, visit their website at learningnetwork.cisco.com
- DevNet is a Developer Program from Cisco that consists of a website, an interactive developer community, coordinated developer tools, integrated discussion forums, and sandboxes. To learn more about what DevNet offers visit their website at developer.cisco.com. Search the internet to see some of the ways people are using the resources provided by DevNet in the development of IoT technology

## 6.2.2 Industry Certifications

- Industry certifications are highly respected by employers around the world and help validate the skills needed to launch successful careers in networking and IT. Certifications are achieved by passing an exam proctored by a certifying authority. Students must complete training materials specific to the certification exam. Field experience is often very helpful, but not always required, to pass a certification exam
- There are two basic types of certifications available: vendor-specific and vendor-neutral. Vendor-specific certifications are tailored to technologies offered by a company to prove that an individual is qualified to deploy and manage that technology. Vendor-neutral certifications are offered by many different organizations. They show that an individual has a well-rounded skillset centered on common systems and programs, rather than specific brands of technology
- Vendor-specific courses are available that prepare students for Cisco industry certifications
- For example, training and other certification resources are available from the Cisco Learning Network

- Cisco certifications that are relevant to the IoT are the following:
    - Networking - The Cisco Certified Network Administrator (CCNA) certification tests a candidate's knowledge and skills related to network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services, security fundamentals, and automation and programmability
    - Security - The Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate (CBROPS) certification tests skills and knowledge in security concepts, security monitoring, host-based analysis, network intrusion analysis, and security policies and procedures
    - Automation - The Cisco Certified DevNet Associate (DEVASC) certification assesses skills and knowledge in understanding and using APIs, Cisco platforms and development, application development and security, and infrastructure and automation
    - Most often, certifications must be renewed over time. Requirements for re-certification may be earning continuing education units (CEUs), passing a re-certification exam, or both. CEUs can be earned by attending classes, professional membership, on-the-job experience, or research and publishing of materials that support the certification technology
